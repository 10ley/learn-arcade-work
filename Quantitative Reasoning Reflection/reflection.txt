Question 1

    There are different methods and techniques to programming. I use if statements
all the time. I use if statements for conditions and Boolean variables. An example
of this is true and false. By knowing if someone this true or false you can trigger
different code. Loops are also very useful. I use loops, so I don't need to repeat
my code. An example of this is for one of my games. I created multiple sprites though
a loop.
    Games are built off of classes. They allow you to give attributes and mechanics
to an object. As well as create code all within one class. You can create
multiple objects within a class. It allows you to put multiple functions together.
Functions allow you to make a set of code you can call upon multiple times. It makes
the code much easier to read. It allows me to chunk my code out into more readable
lines of codes.
    Lists, are amazing. I use them all the time. Lists allow you to create multiples.
Lists allow you to keep a running total of different numbers. They are very helpful
in games because of the ability of lists. The Camel lab, is a great example of
how useful lists are.
    Quantitative methods make up almost all the logic of programming.
